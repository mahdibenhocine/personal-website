<h1>Simple Personal Website</h1>

<h3>An introductory hands-on project I completed to enhance my practical cloud skills by hosting my personal static website on AWS.</h3>

<hr>

This was my first project built on the cloud, completed alongside Rajdeep Saha's tutorial series ([Rocking AWS for Beginners - Hands-On](https://www.udemy.com/course/rocking-aws-for-beginners-hands-on/)). The series provides guidance on provisioning and configuring essential AWS resources like S3 buckets, CloudFront, Route 53, and AWS Certificate Manager. The project involved the following key steps:  

1. Creating an S3 bucket to host my resume.  
2. Distributing content through CloudFront for enhanced latency and security.  
3. Configuring a custom domain name with Route 53 for improved accessibility.
